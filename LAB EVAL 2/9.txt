Consider the facts:

1)The members of the Elm St. Bridge Club are Joe, Sally, Bill, and Ellen.

2)Joe is married to Sally.

3)Bill is Ellen’s brother.

4)The spouse of every married person in the club is also in the club.

5)The last meeting of the club was at Joe’s house.

Convert to predicate logic and prove that “Ellen is not married”.
